    <h2>Find the Valentine</h2>
	<p>You have a Valentine from a secret admirer!  It is in one of the 15 mailboxes below.  You are only allowed to look in one box each day.  Every night a puckish mail room clerk will randomly move your letter one space (left or right) to an adjacent box.  If you do not find it in the month of February, then it will be permanently destroyed.</p>
	
	<p>Fortunately, it's leap year so you get one extra day!  Come up with a strategy that is <u>guaranteed</u> to find your letter in the allotted 29 days and <b>explain</b> why it will work.</p>

	<p>Email your response to <a href="mailto:chris.nord@chemeketa.edu">chris.nord@chemeketa.edu</a>.  The winning response will provide the clearest explanation and will be posted on leap-year day!</p>

    <p>See <a href="test.html">this page</a> if you would like to visualize how the clerk moves the letter each night.</p>
